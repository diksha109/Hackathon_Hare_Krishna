# **Gesture2Health**

Gesture2Health is an innovative project that aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired patients and healthcare professionals in India. The issue of communication barriers between hearing-impaired patients and healthcare professionals is a significant problem in India, where there are an estimated 18 million hearing-impaired individuals. These individuals often face significant challenges in accessing healthcare services due to a lack of communication resources and support. Many healthcare professionals are not trained in ISL or other sign languages, making it difficult for them to communicate effectively with hearing-impaired patients. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnosis, and inadequate treatment, which can have serious consequences for the health and well-being of hearing-impaired individuals. To address this problem, Gesture2Health has developed a state-of-the-art sign language recognition model trained on an Indian dataset of videos for the healthcare domain. The model can recognize a wide range of ISL gestures and translate them into written text in real-time, enabling healthcare professionals to communicate effectively with hearing-impaired patients. The system uses a camera to capture the patient's gestures, which are then processed and analyzed by the model. The model then generates written text output, which can be used by healthcare professionals to communicate with the patient.
