# **Gesture2Health**

Gesture2Health is an innovative project that aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired patients and healthcare professionals in India.  There are an estimated 18 million hearing-impaired individuals in India. Many healthcare professionals are not trained in ISL or other sign languages. The system uses a camera to capture the patient's gestures, which are then processed and analyzed by the model. The model then generates written text output, which can be used by healthcare professionals to communicate with the patient.
